This command-line application will generate a software engineering team summary webpage. The user is prompted through the command line to enter new team member information. Roles amongst the team consist of Managers, Engineers, & Interns. The user is able to enter as many team members as needed.  

Once all team members are added the application will render a new html file.  When loaded in a browser the new html file presents all the team members in a clean and easy to view manner.
